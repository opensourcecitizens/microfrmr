# microfrmr

This an open project. Our objectives are to build an technology driven solutions that allows people to collaborate naturally to solve a basic human need: to find, grow and consume food safely and affordably. 

The goal is add more choices for consumers and farmers through information sharing. This information will allow consumers to find the safest and most affordable food choices closest to them, and it allow farmer to optimize their efforts as food producers. 

Our approach is to define optimization as geographical suitability of food production with low reliance on articial fertilizers. As an example, we can match a chicken farmer with a cabbage farmer to exchange waste. Or a wheat farmer and diary farmer to exchange waste. Or educate farmer on crop and animal rotation to maximize land's soil/micro-organism health.
